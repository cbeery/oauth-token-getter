# OAuth thing

Run this locally, authenticate with services, authorize them, get an access token back. Maybe a refresh token, where applicable.

## Regarding OAuth 2

This [article on Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2) did as much as anything for getting me to understand the OAuth workflow.

### Instagram

Not sure I ever had Instagram all the way working, but I got back to try it July 2021. Found this StackOverflow from July 2020 that explained the old Instagram oauth is deprecated, but you can add a new Facebook app (simmilar to the way I defined an Instagram 'web app' in the developer section of instagram.com) and update the api URLs, scope, etc.

Not sure I will pursue this, because my Instagram is presently *not* associated with any Facebook account.
